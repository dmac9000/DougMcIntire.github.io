									<p>Sergeant and Staff Sergeant promotions happen by MOS and "points". Each month, promotion "points" were published, and if you were above the points listed, you were promoted. I always kept working on getting more points, by completing educational correspondence courses the Army provided, and other activities where I could. My efforts paid off and I was promoted on May 21, 1988.</p>
									<p><strong>Note:</strong> I wish I could remember how many points I had. The maximum number was 1,000. I think I was above 900.</p>
