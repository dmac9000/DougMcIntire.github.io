										<h2>I Attended and Graduated US Army Airborne School</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/army-jump-wings.jpg" alt="US Army Jump Wings" height="116" width="200" />
									<p>The very first day, in formation at oh-dark-thirty, the commanding officer asked us who made a mistake, who didn't want to be there. It was very friendly, no threats, it was a promise to start the out processing right then and there. One-third of the people in formation stepped forward, before one minute of training. It ranked as one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen in my life.</p>
									<p>"Blood Wings" were a constant conversation during my Airborne Training. The "black hats", the instructors at the school, said they weren't given anymore, but on graduation day, if you said the words, "All the way, Airborne," the black hat didn't put the pins on the back of the wings, and punched them into your chest. I was knocked all the way into the rank behind me when I said the words.</p>
									<p>Graduating from Airborne School, gave me another modifer on my MOS. I was now a 31C1P-A4, signifying I was both a "Paratrooper", and Morse Code trained.</p>

										<h2>I Was Promoted to E-2 Today</h2>

									<img src="images/e2-pvt.jpg" alt="E-2 Private Rank" height="250" width="204" />
									<p>There was no pomp or circumstance, no ceremony, it just showed up on my LES (the Army's version of a pay stub). E-1 and E-2 are both privates, but now I got to put some rank insignia on my collar. <strong>Note:</strong> E-2 rank was referred to as "Mosquito Wings".</p>

										<h2>I Attended &amp; Graduated International Morse Code School</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/morse-code.jpg" alt="International Morse Code" height="188" width="400" />
									<p>I started International Morse Code School today at Fort Gordon, Georgia. This will add an A4 Identifier to my MOS. When I completed it, I became a 31C10-A4.</p>
									<p>To graduate, we had to successfully send and receive 25 words per minute in Morse Code. A "word" was five characters. It was very challenging, and probably the catalyst that made me consider getting my Amateur Radio License years later.</p>
									<p>On an interesting note, Rod Sterling, of "The Twilight Zone" fame, was the voice who taught us Morse Code in the training.</p>

									<p>I officially started Basic Training on Friday, January 10, 1986, and graduated approximately 2 months later on March 5, 1986. My mom and dad drove down from Iowa to see me graduate at Fort McClennan, Alabama, near the city of Anniston.</p>

									<p>Without a high school diploma or a GED, I joined the US Army as a Private (E-1). My MOS was 31C &#151; Radio Teletype Operator. I was shipped off to Fort McClennan, Alabama for inprocessing and Basic Training.</p>
