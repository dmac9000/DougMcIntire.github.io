									<p>For: "Outstanding achievement today in being selected First Cavalry Division Artillery Soldier of the Quarter for the Third Quarter, 1987. The expertise you demononstrated in such areas as Military Bearing, Chain of Comand, Individual Weapons, Map Reading, Leadership, and a myriad of other subjects was most commendable and was clearly above that of your peers. Your knowledge, performance, and potential is most noteworthy. Your accomplishment is an example for all to emulate and reflects most favorable on yourself, your organization, and the First Cavalry Division Artillery."</p>
									<p>This was the first step that led me to becoming Soldier of the Year for III Corps and Fort Hood in 1987.</p>

										<h2>I Earned My High School Equivalency Certificate (GED) Today</h2>

									<img src="images/ged-certificate-of-high-school-equivalency-01-22-87-small.jpg" alt="High School Equivalency Certificate (GED)" height="309" width="400" />
									<p>The certificate said, "State of Texas Certificate of High School Equivalency is awarded to Douglas K. McIntire, who demonstrated satisfactory performance in the General Educational Development Testing Program that meets standards prescribed by the Texas Education Agency".</p>
									<p>What it didn't say was that I scored in the top 3% of GED testers.</p>
									<p>The Certificate also came with a note from Crosbie E. Saint, the Commanding General of III Corps and Fort Hood: "Congratulations on earning your High School Equivalency Certificate. This achievement is a significant step in your personal and professional development. Your efforts reflect a desire to be a better citizen and a better soldier. Education programs sharpen your mental slills and give you the essential background for future progress. You now have the basic credentials to move forward in a variety of ways. All best wishes for your continued success."</p>

										<h2>I Was Promoted to Private First Class (E-3) Today</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/army-private-first-class.jpg" alt="Private First Class" height="256" width="200" />
									<p>Again without any pomp or circumstance, I was promoted to Private First Class, E-3 today. No one told me, there was no ceremony, it just showed up on my LES (Leave Earnings Statement), the Army's version of a pay stub, that I was now an E-3. E-2 and E-3 promotions are automatic, at six and twelve months respectively, assuming there aren't any problems. I changed the rank on my uniform to Private First Class, and I went on about my business.</p>
