									<h2><!-- <a href="#"> -->My Accomplishments</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Doug and I graduated with a Master of Arts degree in Adult Education from the University of Phoenix in 2006 and a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of the State of New York, Regents College in 1995. I have spent over 25 years teaching and writing training for certification companies, Fortune 50 companies, and local colleges.</p>
									<p>I am also a veteran of the US Army, honorably discharged in 1995 as a Staff Sergent with 9 1/2 years of service. While enlisted, I learned the Russian language, I was named the 1987 Soldier of the Year for III Corps and Fort Hood, and I jumped out of perfectly good airplanes. Now I like to fish (catch and release), ride my motorcycle - though I do this less frequently these days, and walk on the beach whenever possible with my wife, Maria.</p>
									<p>I've been quite inclusive of my accomplishments here. At the bottom of this page, there are links going back to January 1986. The timeline is from most recent back.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">CompTIA Network+ Certified (again)</a></h2>

									<img src="images/comptia-network-certified-logo.jpg" alt="" height="124" width="300" />
									<p>After months of training my Marketing Team collegues, I was the first to take my CompTIA Network+ certification examination. I passed. After my training, 75% of my team also passed on their first attempt.</p>
									<p>I was originally Network+ certified on Monday, March 15, 2004. My pervious Network+ certification is good for life. I didn't need to recertify, but I did to "lead by example" for the rest of the Marketing Team.</p>

									<p>I became a <strong>Registered Dental Assistant (RDA)</strong>. My wife, a Registered Dental Hygeinist of several years, and I wanted to open a school to register Dental Assistants. She told me that I needed to become an RDA myself, before I could teach it in a school.</p>
									<p>We ran the school for a few months, but both of us were working fulltime. The school became too much of a time burden with our work schedules.</p>

									<img src="images/nano_09_winner_120x240.png" alt="NaNoWriMo Winner for Hard Taffy" height="242" width="122" />
									<p>During the month of November, people from all over the world each work to write a novel before the month is over. A novel, in this endeavor, is considered 50,000 words, which breaks down to 1,667 words a day.</p>
									<p>This year I wrote a novel titled <strong>Hard Taffy</strong>, a story about a young girl, a street urchin, based in the not-so-distant future. I finished on November 29th with 52,780 words.</p>
									<p><strong>Note:</strong> While this book, as all my novels, remain unpublished, it was a wonderful accomplishment to have written my seventh novel!</p>
